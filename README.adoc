For this CMS application, we will implement the OpenAPI Specification linked [here](openapi.yml).

## How To Follow This Example

Each step of the journey will be a new branch in the form of `Step_XXX`, where `XXX` are incrementing numbers for each successive step. In fact, the next step you should look at after this trunk branch should be `Step_001`. Follow the instructions in each branch to continue building your Vert.X Headless CMS application.
